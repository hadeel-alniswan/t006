        <h3> Web Cache  </h3>
        <p class="question"> <em> What is Web Caching? </em> </p>
        <article class="post"> <figure id="WebPic"> <img src="assets/img/webCache1.png"   ></figure> </article>
        <p>
                A Web cache, also known as a proxy server, is a system in a network that helps handle web 
            requests. It works by storing copies of recently viewed web pages and files on its own 
            storage. If your browser is set up to use a Web cache, all the requests you make for web
            content will go to the cache first. The cache checks if it already has the content you 
            need. If it does, it sends it to your browser right away, saving time and reducing the 
            need to connect to the original web server.
        </p>
        <p> 
            The cache acts as both a server and a client:
            •	As a server, it sends stored web content to users when they request it.
            •	As a client, it requests content from the original server when it doesnt already have it stored.
            <br> 
        </p>
       
        <p> <em> How does it work? </em> </p>

       <nav role="navigation"> 
        <article class="post"> <figure id="WebPic2"> <img src="assets/img/webCache2.png"   ></figure> </article>
        <ol> 
            <li> The browser connects to the Web cache and asks for the web page or file it needs. </li>
            <li> The Web cache checks if it already has the page or file stored.
                * If it does, it sends it back to the browser.
                * If the Web cache doesnt have the page, it connects to the original website and asks for it.
                </li>
            <li>  Once the Web cache gets the page from the website, it saves a copy and sends it to the browser.</li>


        </ol>

       <p> <em> What do we benefit from it? </em> </p>

       <nav role="navigation"> 
        <ul> 

    <li>	Faster Response Time: </li>
	<li>	Web caches make websites load faster for users.</li>
	<li> 	Useful when the connection to the original website is slower than the connection to the cache. </li>
	<li> 	If the cache has the requested content, it delivers it quickly to the user.</li>
	<li>	Less Internet Traffic:</li>
	<li>  	Reduces the amount of data traveling between an institution (e.g., company, university) and the Internet.</li>
	<li> 	Helps institutions avoid frequent Internet connection upgrades, saving costs. </li>
	<li>	Reduces overall Internet traffic, improving performance for everyone.</li>
